# Executive Summary: SentryNode Gateway
> **U.S. Patent Pending #63/982,542** | **Founder: Neha Dangwal**

### 🛡️ The Mission
SentryNode is the architectural response to the crisis of agentic scale. [cite_start]In 2026, Generative AI is an infrastructure problem disguised as a software feature[cite: 3]. Without a rigorous FinOps framework, AI initiatives become liabilities rather than assets. [cite_start]SentryNode provides the mediation layer required to align technical sovereignty with capital efficiency[cite: 3].

### 📉 The Challenge: The "AI Tax"
Enterprises are facing a dual crisis as they scale autonomous agents:
1. [cite_start]**Financial Unpredictability**: 80% of AI projects struggle to prove ROI due to skyrocketing token consumption and recursive agent loops[cite: 2].
2. [cite_start]**The Sovereignty Gap**: "Naked" AI execution lacks provenance and security, leaving containers vulnerable to "ghost" compute bills[cite: 2].

### ⚡ The Solution: High-Performance Mediation
[cite_start]SentryNode acts as a strategic mediation layer between agentic applications and model providers[cite: 2]. Our patent-pending architecture implements:
* [cite_start]**Adaptive Inference Routing**: Automatically offloads routine tasks to Small Language Models (SLMs)[cite: 2, 4].
* [cite_start]**Semantic Circuit Breakers**: Real-time interception of recursive agent loops to prevent budget exhaustion[cite: 2, 4].
* [cite_start]**Hardened Sidecar Sandboxing**: Kernel-level isolation via gVisor to prevent unauthorized code execution[cite: 2].

### 📊 Validated ROI & Benchmarks
In a mixed-complexity workload of 1,000 requests, SentryNode delivered:
* [cite_start]**77.6% Cost Reduction**: Dropping unit costs from $5.00 to $1.12 per 1k requests[cite: 2, 3].
* [cite_start]**80% Offload Rate**: Successfully routing routine tasks away from expensive frontier models[cite: 2].
* [cite_start]**98% Semantic Parity**: Maintaining quality via our Shadow Mode validation engine[cite: 2, 3].

### 🤝 The Ask: Design Partner Pilot
[cite_start]We are currently opening our **Q2 2026 Design Partner Pilot**[cite: 2]. [cite_start]We are seeking enterprise partners building agentic workflows who require hard budget guardrails and cryptographic provenance[cite: 2].
