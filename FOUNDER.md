Background
Neha is an AI Infrastructure Architect focused on the intersection of FinOps and Agentic Sovereignty. Drawing on her experience delivering $17M+ in ROI through architectural efficiency, she developed the SentryNode framework to dismantle the "AI Tax"—the unpredictable costs and security liabilities of autonomous agents.

Expertise
* Adaptive Inference Routing: Developing patent-pending logic to achieve 77.6% unit-cost reductions.
* Infrastructure Security: Implementing Shadow Mode and Sovereign Signatures to ensure model parity and provenance.
* Unit Economics: Pioneering "Atomic Tracking" to provide real-time ROI for enterprise AI workloads.

The Mission
Neha is currently seeking a Technical or Business Co-Founder to help scale SentryNode from a foundational framework into a production-grade sovereignty layer.
