# Research Pillars: The SentryNode Gateway Framework
### Technical Overview: Adaptive Routing, Shadow Mode, and Unit Economics

**U.S. Patent Pending #63/982,542 | Founder: Neha Dangwal**

## Pillar 1: The "Agentic Golden Path"

Architectural chaos leads to token waste. The Golden Path provides pre-governed templates for Adaptive Inference Routing — the core mechanism behind SentryNode Gateway's 80% task offload rate.

- **Mechanism:** Proprietary mediation logic evaluates request intent to optimize model selection. Routine tasks route to cost-optimized models; complex reasoning tasks route to frontier models.
- **Result:** 80% of workload offloaded away from frontier pricing — validated across 1,000 mixed-complexity requests.
- **Demo:** See `test_guardrails.py` for the public routing simulation.

## Pillar 2: Inference Observability via Shadow Mode

To maintain intelligence parity while optimizing model selection, SentryNode Gateway implements Shadow Mode Mirroring (Claim 107).

- **Mechanism:** Production requests handled by optimized models are mirrored to frontier models in the background to verify accuracy. The evaluation runs asynchronously — zero latency impact on the primary response path.
- **Result:** 98.2% semantic match — quality maintained with zero capability loss.
- **Demo:** Run `test_shadow.py` to see Shadow Score validation in action.

## Pillar 3: Unit Economics & Hard Governance

The critical metric in 2026 is **Cost Per Successful Task.**

- **Atomic Tracking:** Individual request savings logged in real time to provide live ROI dashboards via the Sovereign Ledger.
- **12.5x ROI Multiplier:** The governance layer pays for itself — verified under production-equivalent workloads (Claim 112).
- **Semantic Circuit Breakers:** Recursive agentic loops identified and terminated within 40ms — validated under adversarial attack simulation. Prevents ghost bills and infinite spend scenarios (Claim 4).
- **Demo:** Execute `test_guardrails.py` to see recursive loop detection and termination live.

## Pillar 4: Sovereign Security Architecture

Beyond cost, SentryNode Gateway enforces infrastructure-level security for autonomous execution.

- **Sovereign Signatures:** Every response cryptographically enforced — 100% model provenance, preventing unauthorized model spoofing. Implementation details maintained as private IP.
- **Hardened Execution:** Kernel-level isolation for agent-generated code execution, preventing container breakouts and reducing the attack surface. Configuration details maintained as private IP.
- **Fiscal Guardrails:** Resource caps prevent infinite compute loops from generating ghost bills — bridging security hardening with cost governance.
- **Sovereign Rate Limiting:** 50% of a simulated high-velocity attack neutralized at the perimeter — verified March 2026.
