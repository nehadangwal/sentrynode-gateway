Architecting Technical Sovereignty for the AI Era.
SentryNode is a high-performance framework designed to eliminate the "AI Tax." As organizations scale, they face a dual crisis: unpredictable token costs and the security risks of autonomous agents.
SentryNode implements Adaptive Inference and FinOps Guardrails to ensure every token spent translates to business value, achieving an average of 77.6% cost reduction without quality loss.

🚀 The Core Mission: Solving the "AI Tax"
In 2026, the primary hurdle for AI deployment isn't capability—it's efficiency. 
SentryNode acts as a strategic mediation layer that enforces The Golden Path for every request, ensuring that high-intelligence frontier models are reserved only for tasks that require them.

✨ Key Capabilities (Updated 2026)
* Adaptive Routing (FinOps Engine): Automatically offloads routine tasks to Small Language Models (SLMs). Real-time visibility allows for immediate cost-avoidance calculation.
* Sovereign Signatures & Provenance: Every response is now cryptographically enforced (HMAC-SHA256). This ensures 100% provenance of the "Student" model output, preventing unauthorized model spoofing.
* Semantic Circuit Breakers: Monitors for sub-second semantic repetition to kill recursive agentic loops before they exhaust cloud budgets.
* Hardened Sidecar Sandbox (SAE): Uses gVisor (runsc) to provide user-space kernel isolation. Recently updated to a minimalist Python-native footprint, removing OS-level binaries like curl to significantly reduce the container attack surface.

⚡ Quick Start: Experience the 77.6% Savings
Test the governance and loop-protection logic in Mock Mode (no API keys required).

1. Installation
```
    git clone https://github.com/nehadangwal/sentrynode-gateway.git
    cd sentrynode-gateway
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the Governance & Loop Test
Observe how the system detects recursive loops and switches to the most cost-efficient route.
```
    export MOCK_MODE=true
    python3 test_guardrails.py
```

3. Run Shadow Mode Verification
See the FinOps engine calculate "Cost Avoidance" in real-time.

    export MOCK_MODE=true
    python3 test_shadow.py
```

⚡ Quick Start: Docker Environment
  Experience the governance and sovereignty logic using our hardened container setup.
```
    # 1. Build the Hardened Environment
    docker compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yaml up -d --build
    
    # 2. Verify Sovereign State (HMAC Signed Request)
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/v1/chat \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"prompt": "Analyze efficiency metrics", "user_id": "audit_user_01"}'
    
    # 3. Audit the FinOps Ledger (Redis)
    docker exec -it sentrynode_cache redis-cli HGETALL stats:audit_user_01
```
