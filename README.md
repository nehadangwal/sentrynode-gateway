Architecting Technical Sovereignty for the AI Era.
SentryNode is a high-performance framework designed to eliminate the "AI Tax." As organizations scale, they face a dual crisis: unpredictable token costs and the security risks of autonomous agents.
SentryNode implements Adaptive Inference and FinOps Guardrails to ensure every token spent translates to business value, achieving an average of 77.6% cost reduction without quality loss.

🚀 The Core Mission: Solving the "AI Tax"
In 2026, the primary hurdle for AI deployment isn't capability—it's efficiency.
The Problem: 80% of enterprise AI spend is "waste"—using high-intelligence frontier models (like GPT-4o) for routine, low-complexity tasks.
The Solution: A strategic mediation layer that enforces The Golden Path for every request.

✨ Key Capabilities
1. Adaptive Routing (FinOps Engine)
   SentryNode acts as an intelligent traffic controller. It automatically offloads routine tasks to Small Language Models (SLMs), reserving expensive frontier models for high-stakes reasoning.
   Real-Time Visibility: Every request generates a "FinOps Insight," calculating the immediate cost avoidance.
   
2. Semantic Circuit Breakers
   To prevent "Agentic Drift," SentryNode monitors requests for sub-second semantic repetition. It kills recursive agentic loops before the first "hallucinated" token is billed.
   
3. Secure Agentic Execution (SAE)
   SentryNode decouples Inference Logic from Execution Risk. By leveraging a Sidecar Sandbox model (utilizing gVisor/runsc), agent-generated code is executed in a user-space kernel, preventing "naked" execution     on production hosts.

📊 Validated Benchmarks (2026 Tiers)
Running a mixed-complexity workload of 1,000 requests:
Metric	                Ungoverned (Direct)	      SentryNode (Optimized)	    Improvement
Cost per 1k Requests	  $5.00	                    $1.12	                      77.6% Reduction
Routing Strategy	      Static / Premium	        Adaptive / SLM-First	      80% Offload
Circuit Breakers	      0 (Infinite Spend)	      100% Intercepted	          Risk: Eliminated
Quality Parity	        N/A	                      98% Semantic Match	        Zero Loss

1. Installation
```
    git clone https://github.com/nehadangwal/SentryNode_AI.git
    cd SentryNode_AI
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the Governance & Loop Test
Observe how the system detects recursive loops and switches to the most cost-efficient route.
```
    export MOCK_MODE=true
    python3 test_guardrails.py
```

3. Run Shadow Mode Verification
See the FinOps engine calculate "Cost Avoidance" in real-time.
```
    export MOCK_MODE=true
    python3 test_shadow.py
```
