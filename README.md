# 🌉 SentryNode Gateway 
### Architecting Technical Sovereignty for the AI Era

> **Your AI agents are billing you while they sleep.**
> 80% of enterprise AI spend is waste. SentryNode cuts that by 77.6%. Zero quality loss.

> *"The metric that matters in 2026 isn't just Accuracy — it's Cost Per Successful Task."*

## 🎯 Is SentryNode Gateway right for you?

✅ Spending **>$10K/month** on LLM inference  
✅ Running autonomous agents (not just chatbots)  
✅ Need cost accountability across multiple model providers  
✅ Post-Series A — AI cost is becoming a board conversation  

❌ Not the right fit: single-model integrations, <$1K/month spend, 
prototype-stage projects

SentryNode Gateway is a high-performance governed gateway designed to eliminate the **"AI Tax."** As organizations scale autonomous agents, they face a dual crisis: unpredictable token costs and the security risks of unverified model execution. SentryNode Gateway implements Adaptive Inference and FinOps Guardrails to ensure every token spent translates to business value.

## 🛡️ Patent Information
**U.S. Patent Pending · Application No. 63/982,542 · Filed February 13, 2026**

SentryNode Gateway is open core. The framework — benchmarking suite, circuit breaker logic, shadow mode validation engine, and governance scaffolding — is fully open under Apache 2.0. Enterprise teams can evaluate, test, and benchmark the governance architecture without any proprietary components.
The proprietary layer (adaptive routing engine, Semantic Decision Matrix, enterprise sandbox configurations) is available to design partners and enterprise customers. Contact partners@sentrynodegateway.com.

- **Adaptive Inference Routing** — SLM-First strategy for dynamic cost optimization
- **Shadow Mode Validation Engine** — Parallel quality parity checks 
- **Semantic Circuit Breaker** — Recursive loop detection and sub-second interception
- **Sidecar Sandbox Execution** — Kernel-level isolation for agentic code

## 🚀 The Problem: The "AI Tax"
In 2026, 80% of enterprise AI spend is waste — high-intelligence frontier models handling low-complexity tasks, compounded by recursive agent loops that can exhaust a month's budget in minutes. Without a governance layer, autonomous agents are prone to **Agentic Drift**.

Three things converged to make this a board-level crisis:
- Agentic AI went mainstream
- LLM costs stopped declining
- Boards started demanding AI ROI

---

## 💡 The Solution: The "Golden Path"
SentryNode Gateway acts as the strategic mediation layer between agentic applications and model providers:

- **Adaptive Routing** — Automatically offloads routine tasks to cost-efficient models, reserving frontier intelligence for complex reasoning
- **Shadow Mode Mirroring** — Background-validates output quality to ensure 98.2% semantic parity with zero capability loss
- **Semantic Circuit Breakers** — Intercepts recursive agentic loops within 40ms before they reach the model provider
- **Sovereign Signatures** — Every response cryptographically signed for full model provenance

**Adversarial Validation — March 2026:**
- 40ms semantic loop interception under recursive attack simulation
- 50% of simulated LLM-Drain attack neutralized at perimeter
- Redis ledger maintained state integrity under upstream 429 quota failure

---

## 🏛️ Alignment with FinOps Framework 2026
SentryNode Gateway is architected to satisfy the **March 2026 FinOps Framework Update**, specifically addressing the transition from "Cloud Cost" to "Value Realization."

## 🛡️ Secure Agentic Execution (SAE)
SentryNode Gateway implements a Sidecar Sandbox model to ensure agent-generated code never runs "naked" on production hosts:

- **Kernel Isolation** — User-space kernel for agentic code execution, preventing container breakouts
- **Fiscal Guardrails** — Resource caps to prevent Ghost Bills from infinite CPU-heavy loops
- **Environment Awareness** — Automatically detects host OS to apply appropriate security tiers
- **Sovereign Signatures** — HMAC-SHA256 cryptographic enforcement on every response

*"SentryNode Gateway isn't just a tool; it's a technical implementation of the 2026 FinOps Standard."*
